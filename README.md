# Stock-in-Nasdaq100-after-Rebalance-Predicting

This project involves analyzing stock market data using Python libraries. Here's a summary of its key components and steps:

1. **Setup and Libraries**: 
   - The project uses libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `pandas_datareader`, `yfinance`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation, visualization, and financial data retrieval.

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - **Single Stock Data**: The `get_stock_data` function fetches historical stock data for a given ticker symbol from Yahoo Finance between specified start and end dates.
   - **Multiple Stocks Data**: The `get_data_for_multiple_stocks` function retrieves data for multiple stocks (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, META, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA) and stores it in a dictionary.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Pivot Data**: The `pivot_tickers_to_columns` function pivots stock data so that each stock's data is organized into columns, making it easier to compare prices and volumes across different stocks.
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - **Plotting Prices**: The project plots closing prices for individual stocks and compares multiple stocks on the same chart.
   - **Volume Plotting**: It visualizes trading volumes for specific stocks, using bar charts to display volume trends.
   - **Subplots**: Combines price and volume plots into a single figure with subplots, showing price trends and trading volumes together for better analysis.

5. **Percentage Variation and Returns**:
   - **Daily Percentage Change**: Computes daily percentage changes in stock prices to understand daily fluctuations.
   - **Cumulative Returns**: Calculates daily cumulative returns to track overall performance over time.

6. **Resampling**:
   - **Monthly Data**: Resamples daily data to monthly frequency, using forward fill to handle missing values, which helps in analyzing monthly trends.

This project demonstrates how to use Python to fetch, organize, and analyze stock market data, providing insights into stock performance and trading volumes. It combines data retrieval, transformation, visualization, and basic financial analysis techniques to create a comprehensive view of the stock market.
