# Stock-in-Nasdaq100-after-Rebalance-Predicting

This project involves analyzing stock market data using Python libraries. Here's a summary of its key components and steps:

1. **Setup and Libraries**: 
   - The project uses libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `pandas_datareader`, `yfinance`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data manipulation, visualization, and financial data retrieval.

2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - **Single Stock Data**: The `get_stock_data` function fetches historical stock data for a given ticker symbol from Yahoo Finance between specified start and end dates.
   - **Multiple Stocks Data**: The `get_data_for_multiple_stocks` function retrieves data for multiple stocks (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, META, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA) and stores it in a dictionary.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Pivot Data**: The `pivot_tickers_to_columns` function pivots stock data so that each stock's data is organized into columns, making it easier to compare prices and volumes across different stocks.
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - **Plotting Prices**: The project plots closing prices for individual stocks and compares multiple stocks on the same chart.
   - **Volume Plotting**: It visualizes trading volumes for specific stocks, using bar charts to display volume trends.
   - **Subplots**: Combines price and volume plots into a single figure with subplots, showing price trends and trading volumes together for better analysis.

5. **Percentage Variation and Returns**:
   - **Daily Percentage Change**: Computes daily percentage changes in stock prices to understand daily fluctuations.
   - **Cumulative Returns**: Calculates daily cumulative returns to track overall performance over time.

6. **Resampling**:
   - **Monthly Data**: Resamples daily data to monthly frequency, using forward fill to handle missing values, which helps in analyzing monthly trends.

This project demonstrates how to use Python to fetch, organize, and analyze stock market data, providing insights into stock performance and trading volumes. It combines data retrieval, transformation, visualization, and basic financial analysis techniques to create a comprehensive view of the stock market.

### Tools and Libraries
1. **Python**: Main programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
2. **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.
3. **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
4. **pandas_datareader**: Fetches financial data from sources like Yahoo Finance.
5. **yfinance**: Retrieves historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
6. **Matplotlib**: Plots data and visualizations.
7. **Seaborn**: Enhances visualizations with additional styling and color palettes.

### Key Technical Methods
1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - **`get_stock_data` Function**: Downloads historical stock data for a given ticker symbol and date range using `yfinance`.
   - **`get_data_for_multiple_stocks` Function**: Fetches data for multiple stocks and organizes them into a dictionary.

2. **Data Manipulation**:
   - **Data Concatenation and Pivoting**: Combines data from multiple stocks and pivots it to create a DataFrame with stock tickers as columns.
   - **`pivot_tickers_to_columns` Function**: Converts stock data into a format where each stock ticker is represented as a column, facilitating easier comparison.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Time-Series Plotting**: Plots closing prices and trading volumes for individual stocks and compares multiple stocks on the same chart.
   - **Volume Visualization**: Uses bar charts to visualize trading volumes alongside price history.

4. **Financial Calculations**:
   - **Daily Percentage Variation**: Calculates daily percentage changes in stock prices.
   - **Simple Daily Cumulative Returns**: Computes cumulative returns over time based on daily percentage changes.
   - **Resampling**: Converts daily data to monthly data and fills missing values to analyze trends over longer periods.

This project effectively demonstrates how to handle, analyze, and visualize financial data using Python, providing insights into stock price trends and trading volumes.
